# Aurora

Aurora is an alternative, minimal, UI friendly Hacker News frontpage. It's purpose is to display the at-the-time 30 most hot topics being discussed at Hacker News.

Aurora does NOT try to replace the main application that Hacker News is using. Instead it tries to be minimal and to make the reading experience more pleasant while delivering a modern feel on top.

Hope you enjoy the reading experience!
